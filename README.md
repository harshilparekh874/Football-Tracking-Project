# ⚽ AI-Powered Football Player Tracking

With the World Cup on the horizon, I built this project to explore how computer vision and AI can analyze football matches in ways similar to how it's done in professional environments like EA Sports' FIFA.

This system tracks:
- Player movement and speed
- Distance covered
- Ball tracking
- Referee identification
- Team classification

Once complete, I plan to analyze World Cup highlight reels — studying formations, measuring fatigue across halves, and comparing team tactics.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔵 **Player Tracking:** Tracks all players throughout the match and calculates movement speed.
- 🔴 **Ball Detection:** Detects and tracks the ball across frames.
- 🟡 **Referee Detection:** Identifies referees and separates them from players.
- 🟢 **Team Identification:** Assigns players to their respective teams using color-based heuristics.
- 📏 **Distance Metrics:** Calculates how far players have moved.

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions

- 🎯 **Event-aware Tracking** – Detect fouls, goals, shots, and game stoppages automatically.
- 🧠 **Interactive Match Replay** – 2D pitch view with synchronized player positions for tactical replay and analysis.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **AI/CV:** YOLOv8 for object detection, DeepSORT for object tracking  
- **Other Tools:** Roboflow, Ultralytics, SciPy, ffmpeg

## 📹 Example Output

Video samples showing bounding boxes, speed, distance, and team colors overlayed on match footage.

## 📈 Future Use

Once the system is complete, I’ll be using it to:
- Analyze World Cup 2026 highlights
- Break down team formations and player fatigue
- Compare attacking vs. defensive play styles

## 🤖 AI Note

This project leverages modern AI models like YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to transform raw football footage into structured, analyzable data — bridging the gap between broadcast video and real-time analytics.
